			Mercedes-Benz traces its origins to Karl Benz's first internal combustion engine in a car,
			seen in the Benz Patent Motorwagen
			financed by Bertha Benz's dowry[10] and patented in January 1886[11]
			– and Gottlieb Daimler and their engineer Wilhelm Maybach's conversion of a stagecoach,
			with the addition of a petrol engine,
			introduced later that year.
			The Mercedes automobile was first marketed in 1901 by Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG).

				You can charge an electric vehicle easily and conveniently at home
				and save yourself a trip to a filling station. And if you do need to charge while on the road,
				simply use one of the many public charging stations, for example, in the city, at shopping centres or service stations
				Intelligent route guidance can plan your route, including the necessary charging stops.
